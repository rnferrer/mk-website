          <p className='bio'>With the likelihood of school resuming in-person for this upcoming school year, I strive to transition everyone back into the community through highly emphasizing safe spaces filled with healing and love. I believe that especially during a time of heightened mental health issues, the need for community support is essential to retain our community members both academically and mentally. 
          To the community: Although at times it may be difficult to keep yourself afloat, I will always be here as a friend to carry some of your burdens. Lmk if thereâ€™s anything I could do for you, and I will do anything within my capacity to be the person you need.</p>
